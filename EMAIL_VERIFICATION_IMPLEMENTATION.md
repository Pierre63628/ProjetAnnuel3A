- **File**: `frontend/nextdoorbuddy/src/pages/VerificationSent.tsx`
- Confirmation page after registration
- Clear instructions for users
- Navigation to verification page

### 6. Frontend Authentication Flow Updates ✅
- **File**: `frontend/nextdoorbuddy/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added email verification functions to AuthContext
- Updated registration flow to return verification data
- Enhanced login error handling for unverified emails
- Added `verifyEmail` and `resendVerificationEmail` methods

- **File**: `frontend/nextdoorbuddy/src/pages/Signup.tsx`
- Modified to redirect to verification page after registration
- No longer auto-logs in users

- **File**: `frontend/nextdoorbuddy/src/pages/Login.tsx`
- Added handling for unverified email errors
- Automatic redirection to verification page

- **File**: `frontend/nextdoorbuddy/src/App.tsx`
- Added new routes for verification pages
- Imported new components

### 7. Environment Configuration ✅
- **File**: `docker-compose.yaml`
- Added email configuration environment variables
- Added verification settings

- **File**: `.env.example`
- Complete example configuration
- Instructions for different SMTP providers

- **File**: `EMAIL_SETUP.md`
- Comprehensive setup guide
- Troubleshooting instructions
- Production recommendations

### 8. Testing & Validation ✅
- **File**: `backend/test-email-verification.js`
- Comprehensive test script for the email system
- Validates configuration, database schema, and functionality

## Security Features Implemented

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 3 verification emails per hour per user
- Maximum 3 verification attempts per code
- Account protection against spam

### Code Security
- Cryptographically secure 6-digit codes
- 15-minute expiration time
- Single-use codes only
- Automatic cleanup of expired codes

### Database Security
- Proper indexing for performance
- Automatic cleanup triggers
- Secure storage of verification data

## User Experience Features

### Smooth Registration Flow
1. User registers → Account created (unverified)
2. Verification email sent automatically
3. User redirected to confirmation page
4. User enters code → Account verified
5. User automatically logged in

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for all scenarios
- Remaining attempts display
- Resend functionality with countdown
- Proper validation feedback

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly verification interface
- Animated components for better UX
- Loading states and feedback

## How to Test

### 1. Configure Email Settings
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your SMTP settings
# For Gmail: use app password, not regular password
```

### 2. Rebuild Containers
```bash
sudo docker compose build
sudo docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Test Registration Flow
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Register with a real email address
3. Check email for verification code
4. Enter code on verification page
5. Confirm automatic login

### 4. Test Login with Unverified User
1. Register a user but don't verify
2. Try to login
3. Should redirect to verification page

## Production Checklist

### Email Configuration
- [ ] Set up professional SMTP service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES)
- [ ] Configure SPF/DKIM records for your domain
- [ ] Test email deliverability
- [ ] Set up monitoring for email failures

### Security
- [ ] Review rate limiting settings
- [ ] Monitor verification completion rates
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular cleanup of expired codes

### Monitoring
- [ ] Track email delivery success rates
- [ ] Monitor verification completion times
- [ ] Set up alerts for SMTP failures
- [ ] Log verification attempts for analysis
